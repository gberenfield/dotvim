My basic .vim setup

vimclojure notes
----------------
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501

in ~/.vim/bundle/VimClojure you'll need to manually install the client/ directory from the source repository
https://bitbucket.org/kotarak/vimclojure

The server can be downloaded at
http://clojars.org/repo/vimclojure/server/

Opening files nicely

  Use peepopen (if on mac) or molly instead
